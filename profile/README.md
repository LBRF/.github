## Welcome to the LBRF GitHub!

This is the home for our lab's general-purpose paradigms, utilities, and analysis tools. The purpose of this page is to provide tasks and scripts that can be used as starting points for specific studies.

The project-specific code for the lab's various studies can be found in the [LBRF Project Repository](https://github.com/LBRF-Projects).
